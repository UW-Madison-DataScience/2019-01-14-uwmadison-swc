  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

<p>For researchers who have no prior experience with programming and just want to get started in some basic skills for organizing, 
  combining, and visualizing data, our <a href="https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/2019-01-16-uwmadison-dc/">UW-Madison Data Carpentry workshop (January 16-17)</a> will 
  likely be more appropriate. These two 
  workshops are NOT intended to be taken back-to-back, and you can learn about future workshops at UW-Madison by joining
